// Publisher represents a giving stream producer, which has giving
// elements it can produce to all giving subscribers. Usually
// it is advised to have a Publisher only accept a single subscriber
// to avoid management details, but this will not be the case for
// Producers who may fan-out elements to multiple subscribers.
//
// Producers can also be called Publishers.
type Publisher interface {

	// listening elements produced by said Publisher. Subscribers will
	// be provided a Subscription object which can be used to request
	// elements from producers, this allows back pressure mitigation
	// techniques and Subscriber based pulling of data which allows
	// efficient management of resources.

// it receives a subscription once and then continuously calls
// for elements until completion based on it's pace.

	// the delivery of giving stream, this can usually mean the tear
	// down of giving subscription by either the subscriber or producer.

	OnError(error)

	// OnCompletion is called when Publisher has completed sending
	// all data elements to subscriber.
	// It may optionally take a giving completion value.

	Next(int) error

	// Stop ends giving Subscription, restoring all resources used up by it's

	// a subscriber immediately as there might be a delay or time taking during tear
	// down where elements may arrive. The idea is to not block in anyway.
